## 为什么 redux 中的 reducers 是 pure function

- Redux simply checks whether the old object is the same as the new object by comparing the memory locations of the two objects. So if you mutate the old object’s property inside a reducer, the “new state” and the “old state” will both point to the same object.

- 延伸思考： 为什么这么设计
- there is only one way to know if two JavaScript objects have the same properties. To deep-compare them. this becomes extremely expensive in real-world apps, because of the typically large objects and the number of times they need to be compared
